= Chronix Spark
An Apache Spark RDD implementation for time series processing - based on Chronix.

== Design Principles
* A `ChronixRDD` is a collection of univariate time series. Each of them has its own vector of timestamps - they are not aligned on one common vector of timestamps.
* Time series are multi-dimensional. Each time series is associated to one or more dimensions. The identity of a time series is the combination of soe of its dimension values.
* `ChronixRDD` has its own storage engine based on Solr Cloud and the Chronix format. So the time series data is stored storage-efficient, sharded and with equipped with
low-level queries to perform predicate pushdown^.

== FAQ

**How does Chronix Spark compare to Spark-TS?**

Spark-TS provides no specific time series storage
it uses the Spark persistence mechanisms instead. This leads
to a less efficient storage usage and less possibilities to
perform performance optimizations via predicate pushdown.

In contrast to Spark-TS Chronix does not align all
time series values on one vector of timestamps. This leads to
greater flexibility in time series aggregation.

Chronix provides multi-dimensional time series.
